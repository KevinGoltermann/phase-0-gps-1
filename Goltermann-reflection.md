* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    I struggled to remember to add and commit all my changes. So alot of the time I have to actively remember to  be saving my changes so tht I will be able to go back and visit the old versions if needed.

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    One of the concepts that was clarified during the GPS was the branch merging. It was easier to see someone else trying to merge and follow along so that I knew how to do the same. Also, it was nice to finally have someone else to merge pull requests on GitHub so I could see how it works with multiple people.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    We asked the guide what the MIT Liscense was and he explained how it's a simplfied copyright liscense for open source coding. We also asked about how "git pull" is similar to the git merge and git fetch commands.

*What still confuses you about Git?
   I'm still confused about small commands and making sure I remember the order of certain words for commands. I think this will be better with time and once I keep using the commands more often.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    Overall, I really enjoyed this experience. I think it's a great way to see other people work and help visualize the coding process.
