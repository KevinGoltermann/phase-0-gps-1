#h1 GPS Reflection 

* The git concepts I've been struggling on before this session were pull requests from Github. I didn't fully understand how to merge it into the master but after the GPS session I was able to full understand that as well as conflicts with commits and merging.

* The concepts that were clarified were merging and pull as stated before. I have a better grasp now, also we got a lot better at figuring out commands when we didn't know what they were. Such as how to link images inline since we didn't know how, google helped us and so did our guide.

* We questioned our guide about the git fetch and git merge as well as asking the guide what the MIT.License. 

* A lot of the small commands such as origin and the way the website is laid out. We had trouble adding a contributer to our repo, we didn't know they sent an email out but with the help of our guide we were able to figure it out.

* It was a lot of fun and working as a team is something I really look forward to. I hope there are more session's like this in the future.
